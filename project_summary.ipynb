    "\n",
    "The lines of code that create the structure of the economy and that create figure 2 in `clean_code.ipynb` are the same as the available code from Auclert et al. This is because the code had significant departures and added levels of complexity than the models we have seen in class (such as the specific transition matrix used or the added beta heterogeneity), and replicating it exactly would have been very complicated. We also focused first on ensuring we could produce the extension (task 2) which took all of the time dedicated to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "It therefore seemed important to us to show that we analyzed and understood the original code instead of just copying and pasting it. To this end, we highlight the existence of the file `code_analysis.ipynb`[here](code_analysis.ipynb), where we analyzed the code provided by the authors (as shown in the many comments and texting filling up on missing information that might have puzzled us originally). \n",

    "The file `clean_code.ipynb` reproduces the code original code and features our main additions. The function `group_c_not_agg` of the household block calculates the cells in which a certain bottom or top percentage of the mass of households is located, and produces disaggregated matrices with the consumption of these cells. The matrices are then automatically aggregated by the toolbox at the steady state and at every period following the shock of figure 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done for the top and bottom 10% and 50% richest. The richest people are defined as the highest level of earnings, and the highest accumulated assets for a certain level of income. Because of the added patient/impatient level of complexity in this model, we make a decision to calculate the mass percentages such that every desired percentage is filled with half low beta, half high beta households' consumptions.\n",

    "This graph allows to study the consumpthion paths of different groups (according to their incomelevel) following a deficit-financed tax cut shock. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we learn from this graph: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The change in consumption (from the steady-state) is higher for the bottom 50%. It makes sense as this group (or at least a major part of it) has a high marginal propensity to consume (MPC). Thus, the additional income received from the deficit-financed tax cut will be almost immediately spent, explaining the positive and significant change in output. We also plot the baseline case, i.e. the impulse response function of the aggregate consumption. The aggregate effect seems to be mainly driven by the dynamics of this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The top 10% display a relatively small positive change in consumption, then the consumption slowly go back to its steady state value. It is line with Auclert et al. (2024), richer people have lower MPCs and react less to a deficit-financed tax cut. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The evolution of the top 50% is less clear. It looks like agents tend to decrease their consumption after the shock, but it recovers some periods later. This may be due to the \"excess savings\" phenomenon: people have a buffer-stock behavior, they do not increase wealth indefinitely, once it passes a threshold, people spend down their excess savings. Thus, people could first save (and don't consume) and after some time, they would spend down the excess savings. However, this is just and assumption as we are looking at the top 50% in terms of level of income, and not in terms of wealth. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The evolution of the bottom 10% is surprising. We would have expected it to go up, as these households have the lowest MPCs, and thus are supposed to spend all the tax cut they receive. However, we may be biased by the scale of the graph, relevant for some evolutions, but maybe not to others. Figure 3.c shows that consumption for the bottom 10% actually increases, if we consider a smaller scale. \n"
