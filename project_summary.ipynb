    "The lines of code that create the structure of the economy and that create figure 2 in `clean_code.ipynb` are the same as the available code from Auclert et al. This is because the code had significant departures and added levels of complexity than the models we have seen in class (such as the specific transition matrix used or the added beta heterogeneity), and replicating it exactly would have been very complicated. We also focused first on ensuring we could produce the extension (task 2) which took all of the time dedicated to this project.\n",

    "It therefore seemed important to us to show that we analyzed and understood the original code instead of just copying and pasting it. To this end, we highlight the existence of the file [`code_analysis.ipynb`](code_analysis.ipynb), where we analyzed the code provided by the authors (as shown in the many comments and texting filling up on missing information that might have puzzled us originally). \n",

The function `group_c_not_agg` of the household block calculates the cells in which a certain bottom or top percentage of the mass of households is located, and produces disaggregated matrices with the consumption of these cells. The matrices are then automatically aggregated by the toolbox at the steady state and at every period following the shock of figure 2.  \n",

This must be a bit of a lagged effect of what the authors called the anticipated income from the future boom and the buffer-stock effect. These households could be increasing their consumption because of impatience. This makes sense as this group (or at least a major part of it) has a high marginal propensity to consume. Thus, the additional income received from the deficit-financed tax cut will be spent faster than the richest groups. However, we do not know exactly why the immediate multiplier is lower than that of the top 10.\n",

But the reason for this is unclear, and the top 50, who is richer than and saves more than the bottom 50, should not decrease their consumption this much in comparison and should exhibit a more persistent decaying consumption to steady state levels.\n",
